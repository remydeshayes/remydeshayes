### Hello, I'm RÃ©my! ðŸ‘‹

In April 2022, I moved to London, UK and joined <a href="https://www.integrumesg.com/" target="_blank"> Integrum ESG</a> as the Machine Learning Lead. Currently, I am mainly focusing on building NLP models using methods derived from Signal Processing theory. My workdays are also spent thinking about ML scalability as I am fortunate enough to work with (very) large data sets.

Prior to joining, I worked on the connections between Causal Inference, Machine Learning and Data Science at Harvard, where I was a Research Fellow in <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tyler-vanderweele/" target="_blank"> Prof. Tyler VanderWeele</a>â€™s group, and at the University of Washington (Seattle, WA) in <a href="http://timalthoff.de/" target="_blank"> Prof. Tim Althoff</a>'s <a href="https://behavioral-data.github.io/" target="_blank"> Behavioral Data Science Lab</a>.

Here is my <a href="https://remydeshayes.github.io/" target="_blank"> website</a> ðŸ˜„
