I am a Fellow at Harvard, working in <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tyler-vanderweele/" target="_blank"> Prof. Tyler VanderWeele</a>â€™s group. My current research builds causal models to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on health and well-being.    
Previously, I was a research assistant advised by <a href="http://timalthoff.de/" target="_blank"> Prof. Tim Althoff</a> in the <a href="https://behavioral-data.github.io/" target="_blank"> Behavioral Data Science Lab</a> at the Paul G.
